here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15984649/7736506) for a clear explanation of what's going on with the `auto` keyword.\nApparently C++ Lambda functions are just syntactic sugar for callable objects (classes which implement the `operator()` function).\nThe captures are just the member variables of the class, and the method body is just implementing the `operator()` method.\nThe issue that I was running into was trying to write a function with signature:\n```cpp\nvoid calls_lambda(std::function\u003cvoid()\u003e \u0026lambda_func)\n```\nFor this, I tried to create a Lambda function in the following way:\n```cpp\nauto lambda_func = []() { /* do some stuff */ };\n```\nHowever, as explained in [the stack overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15984649/7736506), this is not of type `std::function`, and so the compiler does an implicit conversion which, in turn, returns a *temporary*. \nI guess a temporary is [always an rvalue](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15131683/7736506) which means you cannot create a non-const lvalue reference to it.\nYou can pass it by value or by const lvalue reference.\n\nI wanted to give users of `calls_lambda` the ability to pass in a big `std::function` object, and also be able to change it within `calls_lambda`.\nThe solution is just to create the lambda as a `std::function` explicitly:\n```cpp\nstd::function\u003cvoid()\u003e

Introduction\n\nPart of the issue with getting Jacktrip set up is that there are lots of resources floating around, many of which are extremely outdated.\nAdditionally, there are several pieces of software which are built upon one another and go by similar names (see \u003ca href=\"#jack-vs-jacktrip\"\u003eJACK vs. JackTrip\u003c/a\u003e).\nTo try to grok this I'll lay out some available resources, then try to explain the relevant info about how these pieces of software interact, and also get JackTrip set up so that I can play music with my friends.\n\n# JACK vs. JackTrip\n\nSeveral pieces of software invovled in this have similar names.\nBelow I'll try to sort out what each of them do:\n\n- [JACK Audio Connection Kit](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit) (a recursive acronym) is a [sound server API](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sound_server), and pair of [daemon](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Daemon_(computing)) implementations to provide low-latency connections for audio.\nAs I understand it, it is the interface between applications (e.g. Firefox, Reaper), and the program which provides the sound hardware driver ([AlSA](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/ALSA_(Linux)) in the case of Linux).\nIt is in charge of scheduling so that latency is extremely low -- apparently the default audio daemon, [Pulse Audio](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/PulseAudio) has too high a latency (although it serves a somewhat different purpose as a program).\nNote that this is old software, originally being released in 2002.\nIt has been pretty regularly updated, with the newest release being in 2022.\n\n- [JackTrip](https://github.com/jacktrip/jacktrip) is an opensource software that builds on JACK to network music peformance over the internet. \nThis is also somewhat old software -- one of the documentation sites that I found is dated 2009.\nI think they are now calling this *JackTrip Core*.\n\n- [JackTrip App](https://www.jacktrip.com/jacktrip-app) is (I think) a sleek GUI app which lets you use the JackTrip program. I'm not actually sure if they're different, but the [fancy website](https://www.jacktrip.com/) seems to specifically call it that to make a distinction.\n\n- [JackTrip Virtual Studio](https://www.jacktrip.com/product) is (I think) the foundation's attempt to monetize the whole thing.\nIt's a cloud server which host's the connection between performers.\nI assume people using the JackTrip App must use the Virtual Studio to connect, but somehow it makes it easier for folks to get set up.\nPresumably this is due in some part to not having to host a session (where you have to set up port forwarding and all that), but also because it just makes it easier to connect.\n\nI am interested in using JACK and JackTrip, but not the app or the virtual studio -- I suspect those only work really well if you use the cloud service, and I don't want to pay money.\n\n# JACK1 vs. JACK2\n\n- In short, JACK2 is a rewrite in C++ which also offers multi-processor support.\n- [See here](https://github.com/jackaudio/jackaudio.github.com/wiki/Differences-between-jack1-and-jack2) on the JACK GitHub for more info.\n\n# Learning resources\n\n- The first thing that comes up on a search is the [JackTrip website](https://www.jacktrip.com/). \nWe don't want this.\nIf you scroll to the bottom, you find the JackTrip core.\n\n- [JackTrip core](https://jacktrip.github.io/jacktrip/) has an extremely brief documentation website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).\nIt appears to only be screenshots of the GUI corresponding to certain settings.\nIf you go to `About -\u003e Resources -\u003e CCRMA`, you find more detailed instructions, which I think are older.\n\n- The [CCRMA documentation](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/docs/common/IETF.html) is (I think) academic documentation from the center at Stanford.\nIt seems reasonably complete if you already sort of know what it's already talking about.\n\n- The [JACK Audio Connection Kit](https://jackaudio.org/) website gives more info on the underlying driver.\nThis has some important information for making it work with ALSA and getting it to play nice with PulseAudio.\n\n- Robert Edgar has an [extremely detailed guide](https://www.robertedgar.com/themencode-pdf-viewer-sc/?tnc_pvfw=ZmlsZT1odHRwczovL3d3dy5yb2JlcnRlZGdhci5jb20vQXJ0aWNsZXMvSkFDS1RSSVBfTUFDX0RPXzgtNC0yMDIwLXMucGRmJnNldHRpbmdzPTExMTExMDExMTExMTExMTExMDAmbGFuZz1lbi1VUw==#page=\u0026zoom=auto\u0026pagemode=none) on setting up JackTrip.\n\n# Installation on Linux\n\n### 1. Install JACK2:\n\nFor Debian-based distros, the following commands do this:\n```\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install jackd2\n```\nYou can check that it works with:\n```\njackd --version\n```\nMine outputs:\n```\njackdmp version 1.9.12 tmpdir /dev/shm protocol 8\n```\n\n### 2. Test JACK2\n\nNote that you may have to suspend PulseAudio, as detailed [here](https://jackaudio.org/faq/pulseaudio_and_jack.html).\nFor me, that command looks like:\n```\npasuspender -- jackd -d alsa\n```\nTo test the audio:\n- Start `qjackctl`.\n- If it's not already started, start running JACK with the \"Start\" button. \n- Turn the volume all the way down\n- Click \"Connect\" and make a connection between a `capture` (microphone) and a `playback` (speaker) instance.\n- Snap gently into the microphone while slowly increasing the volume to see whether the snap comes through.\n- If it does, JACK is working properly.\n\n### 3. Install JackTrip\n\nThere's a [guide on the GitHub pages](https://jacktrip.github.io/jacktrip/Install/) which shows how to install:\n```\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:umlaeute/jacktrip\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install jacktrip\n```\nHowever, this version does not have GUI support, and so must be run from the commandline.\n\nInstead, one may download the binaries from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/jacktrip/jacktrip/releases).\nThe Linux one comes with a README.md which gives simple terminal instructions for installation.\nAfter this, you should be able to run `jacktrip --version` from the commandline, or open the GUI with your application selector.\n\n# Notes from when I did this\n\n- The JACK website [recommends you suspend PulseAudio](https://jackaudio.org/faq/pulseaudio_and_jack.html), but the only difference is that PulseAudio syncs and sources show up in the JACK connection panel.\n    - To suspend PulseAudio I had to: `pasuspender -- jackd -d alsa`\n- I could not get my USB or wireless headphones to work for this.\nI had to switch to the standard aux headphones (which, I actually thought the input was broken on my computer, but apparently not).\n    - In both cases, they only showed `system` input and output ports with `capture_1`, `capture_2`, and `playback_1`, `playback_2` respectively.\n    - When I would connect a `capture` to a `playback`, in the case of USB or wireless headphones it would just record and play out on my laptop's inbuilt microphone and speaker.\n    - From the Ubuntu sound settings I could change which volume I was changing (e.g. built-in speaker or USB/bluetooth headphones). \n    Only built-in speaker volume changed how loud my snaps were.\n    - Connecting `capture` to `playback` with aux headphones plays through the headphones no matter what you do -- could not get it to switch between speaker and headphones when they were plugged into the aux jack.\n\n- The JackTrip executable from apt does not include GUI support, which is sort of annoying.\n    - To deal with this, I just downloaded the zip from GitHub and then followed the README.md to install. \n    - Works well, I can launch the GUI from the gnome app selector.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-24T14:29:06.576318624Z","tags":[]},"/notes/linux":{"title":"Linux","content":"\n# Sound driver\n\n## Getting headphone mic to work\n\nSee [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManjaroLinux/comments/pivytl/realtek_alc255_codec_35mm_mic_not_working/) and corresponding [Arch linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Advanced_Linux_Sound_Architecture#Correctly_detect_microphone_plugged_in_a_4-pin_3.5mm_(TRRS)_jack).\nAlso on the Reddit page:\n```\nTested with Gigabyte Aero15 2017 (P65 Model), with ALC255 and set model to dell-headset-multi\n```\n\nSo, It's same codec.

post](https://net2.com/how-to-view-your-sound-card-information-using-the-terminal-in-ubuntu-18-04/) has some helpful commands (even though it's the wrong Ubuntu version).\nThis gives soundcards:\n```\ncat /proc/asound/cards\n```\nThis gives manufacturer details:\n```\nlspci -v | grep -i audio\n```\nThis gives a nice little interface:\n```\nalsamixer\n```\n\n## Modules and configuring ALSA\n\nThe resources I've seen typically modify the `/etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf` file. \nIt seems that the `modprobe.d` folder [passes modules to `udev` which loads them with modprobe on boot](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel_module#Using_files_in_/etc/modprobe.d/).\nThey can have any name, and options are set via:\n```\noptions module_name parameter_name=parameter_value\n```\nIn mine they (additionally) have a different set of syntax of:\n```\ninstall sound-slot-0 /sbin/modprobe snd-card-0\n```\nI guess this is a nice way to use the `modprobe` utility automatically at boot.\nThe `modprobe` utility loads and configures [kernel modules](https://sysprog21.github.io/lkmpg/) (see link for more details).\nSomehow loading and configuring the appropriate modules is the thing that will solve my soundcard problem.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-24T14:29:06.576318624Z","tags":[]},"/notes/neovim":{"title":"Neovim","content":"\n\n-

wrote a widget which allows one to interactively watch a partial Fourier sum converge.\nIn undergrad I was always sort of dubious that all functions (in $L_2$ space) could be represented by Fourier

great [Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics](https://www.springer.com/series/666) to try to skirt around reading [Calculus on Manifolds](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Calculus_on_Manifolds_(book)) -- it was just pretty terse and didn't lay out a lot of the intuition.\nHowever, C\u0026A in E starts off with [Bachmann-Landau notation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Big_O_notation) to simplify the presentation.\nI've thought some about trying to make more visual proofs of some of the theorems in the book (e.g. inverse function theorem, implicit function theorem), but I'm a little technically limited. \nAs a first step, I started writing a widget in Typescript which allows the user to enter in an expression in $x$ and $y$, and then plots the image of a circle of radius $r$ as well as another circle.\nThe user can then zoom in and also change the input circle radius.\nThe idea is that one can graphically investigate the convergence properties of $2D$ functions to get a better intuition for the different asymptotic behaviors.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-24T14:29:06.576318624Z","tags":[]},"/notes/projects":{"title":"Projects","content":"\n# [Hydrodynamics of anisotropically

width=200em alt=\"nematic liquid crystal topological defects\"\u003e\n\nNematic liquid crystals are materials with rod-like particles which tend to align on macroscopic scales.\nHowever, spatially these particles are randomly distributed letting the material flow like a liquid, hence the name.\nWhen quickly frozen, they spontaneously create *topological defects* (see right) which attract or repel in the course of the material relaxing to thermodynamic equilibrium.\nWe study how these defects interact when including that the material can flow, and also in materials which prefer different ways of distorting over others.\n[Image source](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21680396.2013.878672)\n\n# [Phase-field crystals with

defects\"\u003e\n\nCrystalline materials consist of atoms arranged in a lattice.\nThe interatomic forces behave somewhat like springs linking them, and so any compressive forces on the material as a whole result in elastic (spring-like) responses.\nHowever, there are often *topological defects* (left) which shift in position when external forces act on the material.\nThis causes the material to exhibit *plasticity*, whereby it can be permanently deformed.\nWe seek to create a model which combines these two characteristics by representing the lattice as a phase field, and imposing elasticity by simultaneously solving elastic equations from continuum mechanics.\n[Image

several scientific applications, including quantum electronic structure calculations in chemistry and (in our case) calculating potentials associated with orientation-describing order parameters, one must integrate along the surface of a sphere.\nLebedev quadrature is a way to do this numerically which exactly integrates polynomials up to a given order on the sphere, and does so by assigning weights to sets of points that are invariant under the octahedral symmetry group.\nI needed this to calculate the [Ball-Majumdar singular potential](doi.org/11.1080/15421401003795555) and existing implementations had manual memory management (not ideal).\nI wrote this to try to make a cleaner, more readable implementation which also includes more documentation and is easier to include in other projects via conventional methods.\n[Image
