department at the University of Minnesota studying soft matter.\nI tend to get obsessive about technical tasks, especially when they make promises of making other (menial) work easier or more enjoyable.\nThese tasks usually take many hours and are not at all worth it to complete.\n\nI am a computational theorist, and so I code by trade.\nI also really like coding, and try hard to write code that's understandable in cases where external parameters (e.g. deadlines) make that a possibility.\nProficient in C++ and Python, learning Rust and Lua (although there's not much Lua to learn), and learning just enough Scheme to script in Lilypond.\n\nI play music when I have time, and am currently on a crusade to learn [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) and [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/) by transcribing tunes I like.\nTrying hard to brew kombucha with as little effort as possible, because I need a fun little drink every day and I can't be spending $3 per bottle on a grad student salary.\nBig fan of bikes, especially crappy bikes that I can replace all of the parts on with cheap bits from the junk drawer at the bike shop.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-11T04:08:02.651330845Z","tags":[]},"/notes/notes":{"title":"Notes","content":"\n# Neovim\n\n- Configuration files (coming soon)\n- Foward and inverse latex search with

one to interactively watch a partial Fourier sum converge.\nIn undergrad I was always sort of dubious that all functions (in $L_2$ space) could be represented by Fourier series, so I'm hoping this makes it a little bit more palatable. \nI still need to publish the widget (or one I rewrote in Rust) to Github pages, so the link is currently defunct.\n\n# [Introduction to liquid crystals](notes/introduction_to_liquid_crystals.md)\n\nThis was an attempt to write a talk out as a post to try to curb some procrastination (really had some writer's block making the slides).\nIt was pretty silly, and I still need to put in the figures (right now it's all placeholders), so the link is currently defunct.\n\n# [Bachmann-Landau notation widget](https://lucasmyers97.github.io/bachmann-landau/)\n\nI started reading [Calculus and Analysis in Euclidean Space](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-49314-5), one of the really great [Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics](https://www.springer.com/series/666) to try to skirt around reading [Calculus on Manifolds](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Calculus_on_Manifolds_(book)) -- it was just pretty terse and didn't lay out a lot of the intuition.\nHowever, C\u0026A in E starts off with [Bachmann-Landau notation](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Big_O_notation) to simplify the presentation.\nI've thought some about trying to make more visual proofs of some of the theorems in the book (e.g. inverse function theorem, implicit function theorem), but I'm a little technically limited. \nAs a first step, I started writing a widget in Typescript which allows the user to enter in an expression in $x$ and $y$, and then plots the image of a circle of radius $r$ as well as another circle.\nThe user can then zoom in and also change the input circle radius.\nThe idea is that one can graphically investigate the convergence properties of $2D$ functions to get a better intuition for the different asymptotic behaviors.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-11T04:08:02.651330845Z","tags":[]},"/notes/projects":{"title":"Projects","content":"\n# [Hydrodynamics of anisotropically elastic nematic liquid crystals](https://github.com/lucasmyers97/maier-saupe-lc-hydrodynamics)\n\n\u003cimg align=\"right\" src=\"/notes/images/projects/liquid_crystal_topological_defects.png\" width=200em alt=\"nematic liquid crystal topological defects\"\u003e\n\nNematic liquid crystals are materials with rod-like particles which tend to align on macroscopic scales.\nHowever, spatially these particles are randomly distributed letting the material flow like a liquid, hence the name.\nWhen quickly frozen, they spontaneously create *topological defects* (see right) which attract or repel in the course of the material relaxing to thermodynamic equilibrium.\nWe study how these defects interact when including that the material can flow, and also in materials which prefer different ways of distorting over others.\n[Image source](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21680396.2013.878672)\n\n# [Phase-field crystals with elasticity](https://github.com/lucasmyers97/phase-field-crystals)\n\n\u003cimg align=\"left\" src=\"/notes/images/projects/crystalline_defects.jpg\" width=200em alt=\"crystalline topological defects\"\u003e\n\nCrystalline materials consist of atoms arranged in a lattice.\nThe interatomic forces behave somewhat like springs linking them, and so any compressive forces on the material as a whole result in elastic (spring-like) responses.\nHowever, there are often *topological defects* (left) which shift in position when external forces act on the material.\nThis causes the material to exhibit *plasticity*, whereby it can be permanently deformed.\nWe seek to create a model which combines these two characteristics by representing the lattice as a phase field, and imposing elasticity by simultaneously solving elastic equations from continuum mechanics.\n[Image

C++](https://github.com/lucasmyers97/lebedev-quadrature)\n\n\u003cimg align=\"right\" src=\"/notes/images/projects/lebedev_grid.png\" width=200em alt=\"crystalline topological defects\"\u003e\n\nIn several scientific applications, including quantum electronic structure calculations in chemistry and (in our case) calculating potentials associated with orientation-describing order parameters, one must integrate along the surface of a sphere.\nLebedev quadrature is a way to do this numerically which exactly integrates polynomials up to a given order on the sphere, and does so by assigning weights to sets of points that are invariant under the octahedral symmetry group.\nI needed this to calculate the [Ball-Majumdar singular potential](doi.org/11.1080/15421401003795555) and existing implementations had manual memory management (not ideal).\nI wrote this to try to make a cleaner, more readable implementation which also includes more documentation and is easier to include in other projects via conventional methods.\n[Image source](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2018.06.013)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-11T04:08:02.651330845Z","tags":[]}}
