# Introduction

[Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) is a command-line utility which goes through code-bases and documents code based on (a) the code itself and (b) special comments that developers can make to include extra information.
The output is a set of html files which forms a website, or LaTex which can then be used to generate a PDF manual.
Typically these create a list of relevant code objects like namespaces, classes, and files.
Additionally, there is a main page which functions as the opening page of the site, written in html with a `.dox` extension, or written in regular mardkwon.
Also users may specify pages in the same manner as the main page which are just other documentation pages on the site.
