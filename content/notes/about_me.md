I am currently a PhD candidate in physics at the University of Minnesota studying soft matter.
I tend to get obsessive about technical tasks, especially when they make promises of making other (menial) work easier or more enjoyable.
These tasks usually take many hours and are not at all worth it to complete.

I am a computational theorist, and so I code by trade.
I also really like coding, and try hard to write code that's understandable in cases where external parameters (e.g. deadlines) make that a possibility.
Proficient in C++ and Python, learning Rust and Lua (although there's not much Lua to learn), and learning just enough Scheme to script in Lilypond.

I play music when I have time, and am currently on a crusade to learn [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) and [Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/) by transcribing tunes I like.
Trying hard to brew kombucha with as little effort as possible, because I need a fun little drink every day and I can't be spending $3 per bottle on a grad student salary.
Big fan of bikes, especially crappy bikes that I can replace all of the parts on with cheap bits from the junk drawer at the bike shop.
