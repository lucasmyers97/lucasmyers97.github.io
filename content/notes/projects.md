# [Hydrodynamics of anisotropically elastic nematic liquid crystals](https://github.com/lucasmyers97/maier-saupe-lc-hydrodynamics)

- Nematic liquid crystals have particles which are rod-like
- They tend to orient along the same axis on macroscopic scales, if temperatures are cool enough or particle density is high enough.
- This allows them to block or allow light through, depending on polarization.
- They are also able to flow like a liquid, although their flow is impacted by local particle orientation.
- Finally, they spontaneously create so-called "topological defects" when the material freezes which attract or repel in the course of the material relaxing to thermodynamic equilibrium -- see below for examples of topological defects.
- We study how these defects interact when including that the material can flow, and also in materials which prefer different ways of distorting over others.

    caption="Examples of nematic liquid crystal topological defects. They are characterized by how the particles rotate as one traverses a path around the defect point. For example, (d) is a +1/2 defect because the particles rotate $180^\circ$ as one goes once around the defect point."  >}}
