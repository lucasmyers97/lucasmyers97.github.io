Nematic liquid crystals are materials with rod-like particles which tend to align on macroscopic scales.
However, spatially these particles are randomly distributed letting the material flow like a liquid, hence the name.
When quickly frozen, they spontaneously create so-called "topological defects" (see right) which attract or repel in the course of the material relaxing to thermodynamic equilibrium.
We study how these defects interact when including that the material can flow, and also in materials which prefer different ways of distorting over others.
