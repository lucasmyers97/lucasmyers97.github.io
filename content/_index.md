👋 Welcome to my website! 
It's here to showcase my professional work, and also help motivate me to take better notes.
Ideally it will eventually follow a [Zettelkasten](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Zettelkasten) type of organization, but for now you can find most of the main sections below.

- 🖥️ [Projects](notes/projects.md): 
    Mostly PhD work, but sometimes hobby projects. Largely code, sometimes scrutable.

- 📓 [Notes](notes/notes.md)
    Personal notes that I write to remember (typically technical) details of things I'm working on. Mostly scraps.

- 📰 [Posts](notes/posts.md)
    More carefully written-out documents, either for things that I would *really* like to remember or that might be helpful for others.

- 😁 [About me](notes/about_me.md)
