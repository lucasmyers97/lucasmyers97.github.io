# [Projects](notes/projects.md)

Mostly PhD work, but sometimes hobby projects. Largely code, some of which might be scrutable and able to be used by others.

# [Notes](notes/notes.md)

Personal notes that I write to remember (typically technical) details of things I'm working on. Typically not very clear or explanatory.

# [Posts](notes/projects.md)

More carefully written-out documents, either for things that I would *really* like to remember or that might be helpful for others.
